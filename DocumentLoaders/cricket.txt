Under a waking amber sky,
Where dust and sunlight softly lie,
A whisper runs through crowded stands—
A nation breathes with folded hands.
White lines drawn on emerald ground,
Hope in every spinning round,
The bowler marks his measured pace,
Fire and focus in his face.
Leather sings through heated air,
A seam that splits the batter’s stare,
Willow answers—crack of fate—
Cheers erupt, the moment great.
Fielders glide like shadows cast,
Chasing seconds racing fast,
A diving stop, a fingertip save,
Turns the timid into brave.
Scoreboards flicker, tension tight,
Day dissolves to painted night,
Under lamps the battle stays—
Cricket writes in patient ways.
Not just runs on paper scored,
But silent grit and trust restored,
From gully games on broken streets
To roaring crowds in grand repeats.
It’s tea breaks, tactics, steady nerves,
A bouncer’s snarl, a spinner’s curves,
It’s heartbreak edged, a near-miss sigh,
And centuries that touch the sky.
So when the final echo fades,
And footprints mark the grassy blades,
One truth remains, steadfast and slick—
Life, like cricket, plays by the tick.
